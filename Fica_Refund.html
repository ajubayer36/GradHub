    <h1>FICA Refund</h1>
    <p>
        The FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) refund is a potential refund available to certain foreign students, scholars, and cultural exchange visitors in the United States who may have overpaid Social Security and Medicare taxes while on specific visa statuses.

        To determine your eligibility and apply for a FICA refund, you should follow the guidelines and procedures provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The refund process can vary based on your individual circumstances, including your visa status and the length of your stay in the U.S.
