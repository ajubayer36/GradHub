                    One of the best known swimming holes is Blanchard Springs Recreation Area just north of Mountain View in north central Arkansas. At the recreation area, you'll find ample opportunities for swimming, fishing, picnicking and hiking, surrounded by picturesque bluffs. There are also outdoor theatre programs in season and tours are offered at Blanchard Springs Caverns. To get to Blanchard, take Ark. 9 north from Mountain View for seven miles, go west for six miles on Ark. 14, then take Forest Service Road 1110 for three miles.

                <div class="description">
                    The falls spill into a lovely and large pool, perfect for swimming. It’s also easy to access as it is right by the road. At the junction of Arkansas 7 and 16 at Pelsor, turn east on 16 to Ben Hur, then south about 1.5 miles to Forest Service Road 1205. Turn east on this road and remain on it for about 3 to 4 miles (maybe less). You’ll be following Falling Water Creek and will come upon the falls to your right — easily visible from the road.
